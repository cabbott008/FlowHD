I invested heavily in a layout optimized for minimal movement and got up to my best typing ever with it by a small margin. I found that economy of motion may not be the best in terms of actual speed development revealed by the use of https://www.burst-type.pro. I consistently was faster when the word had more movement as opposed to less, and some of the most effecient words in terms of required movement tended to be the ones I had the most trouble with. This led be to accepting that, though economy of motion sounds good in theory, it may get in the way of my goal of developing typing speed. I'm now at new heights of speed using Qwerty. By the way, this was a multi-year discovery process and I had also had a multi-year run with Colemak about a decade ago. I'm quite thankful for this realization overall, of course, there are many areas of life that a similar "theory vs. practice" disparity exists.
